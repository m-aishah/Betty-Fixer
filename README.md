<h2> :four_leaf_clover: Overview </h2>
This project is the portfolio project that marks the 9th month of our jouney since we started "doing hard things".
<br>
<br>
As part of the requirements of graduating from the foundations stage to the specialization stage of the ALX Software Engineering Program, we have been tasked to develop a Portfolio project. And we (Aishah and Eze) have decided to create <b><i>"The Betty Fixer"</b></i>.

<h2> :question: What is the Betty Fixer? </h2>
Betty Fixer is a command line application built to fix betty errors in a specified C file. It was built for the purpose of helping a programmer with betty errors so that the resources that would have gone into worrying about such errors can be employed in more important areas (like the actual logic of the code).

<h2> :hammer: Setup & Usage </h2>

<h4> Dependencies</h4>
<ul>
<li> GCC - C compiler </li>
<li> The Betty Program </li>
</ul>

---
<ol>
<li> In order to use BettyFixer on your C Program. First, clone the the Betty Fixer repository.


``` bash
git clone https://github.com/m-aishah/Betty-Fixer.git
```
</li>

<li> Next, navigate into the Betty fixer directory.

```bash
cd Betty-Fixer
```
</li>

<li> Using gcc, compile all the .c files in the Betty-Fixer directory.

```bash
gcc -o bettyFixer *.c
```
</li>

<br>And you are good to go. All you have to do is to run the executable '<i>bettyFixer</i>' with whatever file you need t fix!

For instance:
```bash
./bettyFixer path_to_c_file
```

<h2> :fire: Future Updates </h2>
This project is still in the early stages. Here is a list of expected upgrades in coming weeks

<br>
<ul>
<li> Apply parallel programming with Threads. </li>
<li> Implement functionality to fix Betty Documentation errors.</li>
<li> Work on more efficient way of setting up the Betty Fixer.</li>
</ul>
