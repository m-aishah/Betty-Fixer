<h1> THE BETTY FIXER </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>
This project is the portfolio project that marks the 9th month of our jouney since we started "doing hard things".
<br>
<br>
As part of the requirements of graduating from the foundations stage to the specialization stage of the ALX Software Engineering Program, we have been tasked to develop a Portfolio project. And we (Aishah and Eze) have decided to create <b><i>"The Betty Fixer"</b></i>.
